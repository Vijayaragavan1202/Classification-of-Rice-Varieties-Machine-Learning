This study has been focused on classification of five rice varieties namely Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, 
and Karacadag using machine learning techniques.
 
• Classification models such as k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for the classification 
of five rice varieties. 
• The study aims to demonstrate that integrating morphological, shape and color features can enhance 
classification accuracy. 
• Average Accuracy of 99.86% was obtained and major reduction of features (from base-paper) was done, from 
which the training time was reduced by 46.00% and space complexity was reduced by 54.00%
